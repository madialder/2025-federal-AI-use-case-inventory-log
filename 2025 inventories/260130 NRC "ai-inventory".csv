NRC-0001,Text Retrieval and Generation for NRC Staff Support,NRC,CAIO@nrc.gov,a) No,c)  Deployed – The use case is being actively authorized or utilized to support the functions or mission of an agency.,c) Not high-impact,,Energy & the Environment,Generative AI,"NRC staff are required to discover, retrieve, and analyze information from internally-managed and externally-provided documents.  These documents can be lengthy as well as dense with content and often require cross-reference against multiple policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures. The process of discovery, retrieval, analysis, and cross-reference is time consuming and often represents the most significant bottleneck in carrying out agency activities and in making agency decisions.","This use case enhances the NRC’s efficiency and consistency in licensing, oversight, and other regulatory activities. It enables more efficient capture and use of institutional knowledge to mitigate against the risks associated with staff attrition. The NRC expects this use case to improve the timeliness of its risk- and policy-informed decisions, supporting its mission to enable the safe and secure use and deployment of civilian nuclear energy technologies and radioactive materials.","The output is semi-structured content (e.g., text and tables) responsive to the NRC staff's queries.",08/01/2025 00:00:00,c) Developed with both contracting and in-house resources,TekSynap,Yes,SimplifAI,"Where appropriate, prior NRC records are used in concert with subject matter expert review to evaluate the performance of the model's outputs.",, No,,None of the above,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
