## 🔎 What's in this table?
Per guidance, agency inventory postings should be located at [AgencyName.gov]/ai but sometimes they're published at other urls. The links reflect either where the inventory was posted or where I believe it will be posted.

If I was able to locate the 2025 inventory, that agency gets a ✅ in the "2025 posted" column. If I couldn't find it, it's an ❌.

💡 NOTE: This year, agencies began posting "commercial" or "consolidated" use case inventories with common uses across the agency *in addition* to their standard annual posting. Agencies that have posted such a file, have a ✅ in the "Commercial inventory" column and agencies that didn't have an ❌.

## 🗂️ File guide
All of the downloaded files are available in the "2025 inventories" folder. The standard inventories are in the main folder and the newly minted "commercial" inventories are in their own subfolder.

 For organization, the naming convention is a combination of the agency name, the file version, and the original file name. 

    Here's how the naming convention works using //DHS 260130 "2025 DHS AI Use Case Inventory_".xlsx// as an example:

        ➡️ DHS = The Department of Homeland Security
        ➡️ 260130 = The date I downloaded the file, which was January 30, 2026
        ➡️ "2025 DHS AI Use Case Inventory_" = The original name of the file when I downloaded it from the website. 
        ➡️ .xlsx = The file type!

The commercial inventories are the same, but have a "c" following the agency name.

💡 TIP: Having the original file name is helpful for archival purposes, but shorter file names are always better for analysis! I recommend deleting that part or changing the name entirely if you download, particularly if you're planning to work with multiple files. 

❗ IMPORTANT NOTE: There may be more than one file for each agency if they update their inventory. Please check the date in the file name to ensure that you're looking at the most-up-to date information. The agency abbreviation is listed first to group any files related to that agency together.
